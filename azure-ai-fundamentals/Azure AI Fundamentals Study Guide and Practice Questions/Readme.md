## CHAPTER 3 – IDENTIFY COMMON MACHINE LEARNING TYPES
  - Supervised Learning
    - Classification: uses supervised learning to label data
    - Regression: uses supervised learning to predict numerical data
  - Semi-supervised learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
    - Clustering: uses unsupervised learning to find patterns in the data
    - Anomaly detection: uses unsupervised learning to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior
    - Dimensionality reduction: uses unsupervised learning to reduce the number of variables in a dataset
  - Reinforcement Learning: tries to achieve a goal through random trial and error by grading the performance of each attempt
