## Understand steps for classification
  - Prepare data
  - Train models
  - Evaluate performance
    - Confusion matrix
      - Accuracy
      - Precision
      - Recall (True positive rate)
      - F1 score
    - Choosing a threshold
    - ROC (receiver operating characteristic) courve and AUC metric
    - AUC (area under the curve) metricï¼Œ the larger the AUC (0,1) the better the model is. If the AUC for your model is higher than 0.5 for a binary classification model, then the model performs better than a random guess
  - Deploy a predictive service
    - Inference pipeline
    - Deployment
