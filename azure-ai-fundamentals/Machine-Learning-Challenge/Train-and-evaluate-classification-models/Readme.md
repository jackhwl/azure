## Introduction
## What is classification?
  - Training and evaluating a classification model
## Exercise - Train and evaluate a classification model
## Evaluate classification models
  - Accuracy: (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) - out all of the predictions, how many were correct?
  - Recall: TP/(TP+FN) - of all the cases that are positive, how many did the model identify?
  - Precision: TP/(TP+FP) - of all the cases that the model predicted to be positive, how many actually are positive?
## Exercise - Perform classification with alternative metrics
  - precision_score: Of all the patients the model predicted are diabetic, how many are actually diabetic?
  - recall_score: Of all the patients that are actually diabetic, how many did the model identify?
