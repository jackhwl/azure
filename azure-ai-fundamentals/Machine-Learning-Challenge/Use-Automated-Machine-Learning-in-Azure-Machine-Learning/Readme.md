## What is machine learning? 
  Machine learning is a technique that uses mathematics and statistics to create a model that can predict unknown values.
  - Types of machine learning
    - supervised machine learning
      - regression
      - classification
    - unsupervised machine learning

  - Accuracy: In other words, what proportion of diabetes predictions did the model get right?
  - Precision: In other words, out of all the patients that the model predicted as having diabetes, the percentage of time the model is correct.
  - Recall: In other words, out of all the patients who actually have diabetes, how many diabetic cases did the model identify correctly?
