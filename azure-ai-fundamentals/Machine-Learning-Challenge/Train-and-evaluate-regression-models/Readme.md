## What is regression?
Regression is a supervised machine learning technique that is used to predict a numeric value. For example, you might use regression to predict the price of a house based on its square footage, age, and ZIP code.

  - Mean Square Error (MSE): The mean of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. This yields a relative metric in which the smaller the value, the better the fit of the model
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE. This yields an absolute metric in the same unit as the label (in this case, numbers of rentals). The smaller the value, the better the model (in a simplistic sense, it represents the average   - number of rentals by which the predictions are wrong!)
  - Coefficient of Determination (usually known as R-squared or R2): A relative metric in which the higher the value, the better the fit of the model. In essence, this metric represents how much of the variance between predicted and actual label values the model is able to explain.
