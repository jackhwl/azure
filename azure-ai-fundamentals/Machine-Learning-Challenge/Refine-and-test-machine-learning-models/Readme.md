## Normalization and standardization
  - Normalization versus standardization
  - Why do we need to scale?
  - Scaling gives learning a better starting point
  - Standardization lets parameters train at the same speed
  - Scaling helps with multiple features
## Exercise – Feature scaling
## Test and training datasets
  - What is overfitting?
  - How can we avoid overfitting?
  - What is a test dataset?
  - OK, but what’s the point?
  - What does that mean for cost functions?
## Exercise - Test and train datasets
