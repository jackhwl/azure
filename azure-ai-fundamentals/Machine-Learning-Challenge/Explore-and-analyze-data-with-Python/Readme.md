## Introduction
  * NumPy and Pandas simplify analyzing and manipulating data
  * Matplotlib provides attractive data visualizations
  * Scikit-learn offers simple and effective predictive data analysis
  * TensorFlow and PyTorch supply machine learning and deep learning capabilities

## Explore data with NumPy and Pandas
  - What is NumPy?
    NumPy is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object for fast data manipulation and storage. NumPy is the foundation of the Python machine learning stack.
  - What is Pandas?
    Pandas is like a spreadsheet application for Python, providing easy-to-use functionality for data tables. Pandas is built on top of NumPy, and provides a DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
  - Explore data in a Jupyter notebook
  - Testing hypotheses
    - Clean data：  to handle errors, missing values, and other issues.
    - Apply statistical techniques to better understand the data：  and how the sample might be expected to represent the real-world population of data, allowing for random variation.
    - Visualize data：  to determine relationships between variables, and in the case of a machine learning project, identify features that are potentially predictive of the label.
    - Revise the hypothesis： and repeat the process.
## Exercise - Explore data with NumPy and Pandas
## Visualize data
  - Representing data visually
## Exercise - Visualize data with Matplotlib
  - Made graphs with Matplotlib.
  - Learned how to customize these graphs.
  - Calculated basic statistics, such as medians.
  - Looked at the spread of data using box plots and histograms.
  - Learned about samples versus populations.
  - Estimated what the population of grades might look like from a sample of grades.
## Examine real world data
  - Real-world data issues
    - Checking for missing values and badly recorded data.
    - Considering removing obvious outliers.
    - Examining what real-world factors might affect their analysis and determining if their dataset size is large enough to reduce the impact of these factors.
    - Checking for biased raw data and considering their options to fix the bias, if found.
