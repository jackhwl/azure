## Introduction
## What are machine learning models?
## Exercise - Create a machine learning model
## What are inputs and outputs?
  - The objective: cost function
  - The data
  - The optimizer
## Exercise - Visualize inputs and outputs
## How to use a model
## Exercise - Use a model
  - Training versus using a model
  - Data for use (need feature only), data for training (need feature and label)
    - features: inputs
    - labels: output and correct answer was
  - I've finished training. What now?
    - We no longer need the original data, the objective function, or the model updater.
