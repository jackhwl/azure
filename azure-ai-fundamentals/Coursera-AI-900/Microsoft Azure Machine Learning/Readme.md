## Week 1
### Introduction to Create No-code Predictive Models with Azure Machine Learning
- AutoML train models:
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Time series forecasting
## Week 2 Create a Regression Model with Azure Machine Learning Designer
- regression performance metrics
  - MEan Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Relative Absolute Error (RAE)
  - Relative Squared Error (RSE)
  - Coefficient of Determination (R2)
## Week 3 Create a Classification Model with Azure Machine Learning Designer
  - CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY = (TP + TN)/TOTAL # OF PREDICTIONS
  - PRECISION = TP/ (TP+ FP)
  - RECALL (True positive rate)= TP/ (TP+ FN)
  - SENSITIVITY = TP/TP+FN
  - Confusion matrix
    - Accuracy: The number of correct predictions (true positives + true negatives) divided by the total number of predictions.
    - Precision: The number of the cases classified as positive that are actually positive: the number of true positives divided by (the number of true positives plus false positives).
    - Recall: The fraction of positive cases correctly identified: the number of true positives divided by (the number of true positives plus false negatives).
    - F1 Score: An overall metric that essentially combines precision and recall.
