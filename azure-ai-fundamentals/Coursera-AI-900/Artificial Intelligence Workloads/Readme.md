- Machine learning: is a technique we can use to create predictive models based on data relationships. 
- Anomaly Detector: is a machine learning-based technique that identifies unusual patterns in data sets.
- Object detection machine learning models: are trained to classify individual objects within an image and identify their location with a bounding box.
