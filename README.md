## AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
## Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals Exam AZ-900 (Jim Boyce)
### Chapter 1: Cloud Concepts
  - DESCRIBE CLOUD SERVICES
    - Identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud services
      - Identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, and Disaster Recovery
        - Scalability: horizontal scaling: add more servers to scale out, then scale in (eliminate the additional servers)
                       vertical scaling: increasing the amount of memory to scaling up, then scling down.
        - Elasticity: automatic scaling
        - Agility: Azure makes it very easy to scale resources to meet demand requirements, and Autoscale—once configured—can make it almost effortless to scale resources. The capability to rapidly adjust resources to meet demand is one aspect of cloud agility.
        - High Availability (HA): service level agreement (SLA): Composite SLA = SLA * SLA * SLA
        - Fault Tolerance: generally applies at the component level of a service
        - Disaster Recovery: refers to the process of recovering from a situation where multiple systems or services fail
      - Identify the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
      - Describe the consumption-based model
    - Financial Models: highlights the benefits of moving from a capital expenditure model to an operational expenditure model
    - Cloud Computing Models and Responsibilities:
      - Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):
      - Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): vitualization, IaaS generally has a higher shared responsibility than SaaS
      - Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): provides a development platform that you can use to create and deploy many different types of web applications without worrying about deploying or managing the servers and other infrastructure that support that application
      - Shared Responsibility
